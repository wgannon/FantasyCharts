Project planning

Audiance: MY friends and other people who may want this type of league setup to show additional asic info

Minimum Viable Product: a Webpage specifically dedicated to my own league showing the winner of the weekly challenges. Can expand from there
    -Will need to pull info from the API, figure out a good way to store the info so you can create specific queries on it for the weeekly winners.
        -First question, How to get the JSON for the league info and how is it structured?
